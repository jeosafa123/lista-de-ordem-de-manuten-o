/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EquipTrack App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for product data. Each user has full control over the products they create under their specific user path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All product data is nested under /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/produtos/{productId}. This structure ensures clear ownership and simplifies security rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access product data that belongs to them.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for flexible schema changes.
 * - No user listing is allowed at the root level.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The user ID is embedded in the document path itself (/users/{userId}/...). This avoids the need for denormalized `ownerId` fields within the document and `get()` calls to verify ownership.
